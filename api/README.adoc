=== Database / Model

In order to upgrade the database schema, the schema defined in prisma/schema.prisma needs to be updated.

To update the generated model for code usage, execute `npx prisma generate`. When you are finished and ready for a
commit, use `npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration-name>` in order to create a migration sql script and execute it
on your local database.
